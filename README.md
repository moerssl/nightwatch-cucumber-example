# nightwatch-cucumber-example

I took the example from nightwatch-cucumber and put it into a pull, install and run repository

To run the example just

```
git clone https://github.com/moerssl/nightwatch-cucumber-example.git
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch
```

You will find the cucumber feature in the features folder.
